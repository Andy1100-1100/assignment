  <div class="desc">Manchester United might have found their ideal summer signing

Man Utd are being loosely linked with a move for Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the next transfer window.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has already been given a difficult decision to make ahead of the summer transfer window.
Manchester United's decision to sign Odion Ighalo deep into January transfer deadline day seemed desperate at the time, but now many fans are desperate for him to stay.
With reports suggesting Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is actively looking to leave Arsenal and reports suggest it could be for 'just' £50million, surely it is worth United once again testing a club known to sell to their domestic rivals? If they were able to lure Van Persie from a stronger Arsenal squad, then the Gabonese forward should be attainable.</div>

  <div class="desc">Casemiro and Dani Alves help young Brazilian player who picks 2,000 coconuts a day

Casemiro and Dani Alves have got in touch with a young Brazilian player who is sacrificing so much to make it as a footballer.The story of Gleisson, a 19-year-old midfielder for Petrolina, warmed the hearts of the Brazilian people two months ago when his side competed in the Copa Sao Paulo for the first time.
They lost every one of their games in a competition that's watched by scouts from across the world, but Gleisson made an impact.
It emerged that his father and Gleisson work in a field picking coconuts, collecting around 2,000 every day.
Those 2,000 coconuts are worth 40 reales - the equivalent of just eight euros.
Dani Alves also wanted to express his pride at hearing about Gleisson, who comes from the north-east of Brazil like him, sending him and message and signed shirt.
"Hello, I'm speaking as a player from the north-east," the right-back said.
"I wanted to let you know that it's an honour and satisfaction for us to know that there are people who value our art, who value our people.
"We, as representatives of the north east, are very happy."</div>

  <div class="desc">The Red Devils boss was keen to sign his compatriot, but a lack of support elsewhere at Old Trafford saw the striker opt for the Bundesliga
Manchester United lost out on the signing of Erling Haaland because the whole club was not behind Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's preferred target, claims the star's father. 

Alf Inge Haaland is no stranger to the Red Devils, having tussled with them on numerous occasions during his time with Leeds United and Manchester City in the Premier League. 

It was while playing for the former that he suffered a horrendous knee injury after a rash challenge by United captain Roy Keane, which led to him retiring from football at just 31.</div>
